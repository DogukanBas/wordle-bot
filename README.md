A bot that plays wordle

I used the dataset above for the bot. It was published by Donald E. Kruth. The main idea the bot uses is by deleting words from it's word list and then making a random guess. It starts with picking a random word out of 5757 words. Enters it , then using the result it got it eliminates some of the words in the words list and then makes another guess until it founds it or runs out of chances.

I had to use pyshadow for handling shadow dom elements.
